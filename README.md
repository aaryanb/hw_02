## India vs China GDP Comparison (Line Plot)

China introduced liberal economic reforms in 1978 and India did so in 1991. However, the effect of China's liberalization on its GDP, in comparison to India's GDP, is only evident from the mid-1990s. Moreover, there is a steep increase in China's GDP from the mid 2000s onwards. India, in comparison, saw the effects of its liberalization on its GDP in the mid 2000s. India has seen a decrease in GDP in 2020, due to the COVID-19, while China has not.

## USA vs China GDP Comparison (Scatter Plot)
1. **Data Source #1**: [USA's GDP JSON](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/USA/indicators/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?per_page=5000&format=json)
2. **Data Source #2**: [China's GDP JSON](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/CHN/indicators/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?per_page=5000&format=json)

We are looking at the effect of USA's increase in GDP on China's GDP, and they seem to be positively correlated. This means that as the U.S's GDP increased, so dic China's GDP. This could be due to increased global trade and/or increased trade with eachother. We can see that as the U.S went from 15 to 20 trillion in GDP (1.3 times increase), China's GDP increased 4.6 times. This shows that the positive correlation between the U.S and Chinese economies is steeper in recent history.
